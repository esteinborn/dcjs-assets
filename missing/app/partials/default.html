<p>The Missing Person  Clearinghouse is responsible for providing assistance to law enforcement  agencies handling cases involving children, college students and vulnerable  adults who have gone missing. </p>
<p>Clearinghouse staff  members have extensive experience in law enforcement, training and information  technology, and they provide investigative support services to local, state and  national law enforcement, assistance to left-behind family members and  community education programs. </p>
<p>When it was first  created in 1987, the Clearinghouse focused on cases involving missing children  under the age of 18 and its responsibility was expanded in 1999 to include  missing college students. Since 1999, the Clearinghouse has coordinated Missing  Child and Missing College Student Alerts. Similar to AMBER Alerts, these alerts are  issued when a child under the age of 21 – or a college student of any age –  goes missing and is deemed to be at a credible threat of harm. </p>
<p>In 2011, the  Clearinghouse’s role was expanded once again, and its staff now assists with  the investigation of cases involving missing adults who have cognitive  impairment, mental disability or a brain disorder, and who are at a credible  threat of harm. As part of the expanded mandate to assist with vulnerable adult  cases, the Clearinghouse now coordinates a Missing Adult Alert system, using  the same technology that alerts the public when a child or college student goes  missing.</p>
